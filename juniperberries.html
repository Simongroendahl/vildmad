            <p>1. Start by making iced tea. Place nine grams of tea in a bowl. <br> 2. Pour cold mineral water over it and let the tea steep
            for 24 hours. <br>3. Pour 1 liter of iced tea into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. <br>4. Remove the saucepan from the heat,
            add black tea and green juniper berries. Let it steep for 15 minutes. <br>5. Strain the tea through a fine mesh sieve into
            the jar. <br>6. Pour the sugar into the tea and stir until completely dissolved. Allow the tea to cool to room
            temperature. <br>7. Add 100 ml of kombucha brew, gently place the kombucha mother on the surface of the liquid with clean
            hands. It should float to the top within a few days. If not, it's a sign that it's not viable.</p>
