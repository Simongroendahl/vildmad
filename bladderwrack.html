            <h3 class="h3_recipes">Method</h3>
            <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil with plenty of salt. The water should taste almost like seawater.
                <br>
                2. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. <br>
                3. Meanwhile, cut the seaweed into strips that match the size of the spaghetti. <br>
                4. Finely chop the garlic. <br>
                5. In another pot, heat the oil and butter, and lightly saut√© the seaweed and garlic in it. The seaweed
                and garlic should
                not take on color but should just become translucent. <br>
                6. When the pasta is cooked, transfer it to the seaweed and garlic mixture and toss to coat. Season with
                salt and pepper. <br>
                7. Finely chop the wild herbs and sprinkle them over the pasta.
                Serve immediately.</p>
