            <p>50 g butter <br>
                2 onions <br>
                2 cloves of garlic <br>
                300 g potatoes <br>
                1 l water <br>
                1 dl cream <br>
                300 g herbs - for this soup, a wide variety of seasonal wild herbs can be used. Try to balance the
                selection and
                quantities so that there is a good balance between bitter, sour, or aromatic herbs. For example,
                nettles, ramsons, and
                sorrel. <br>
                Salt and pepper <br>
                Lemon juice <br>
                A handful of wild herbs for garnish</p>
